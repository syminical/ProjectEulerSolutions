Please consider solving the problems yourself **before** looking at my solutions. --- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

This is a collection of my code, written to solve problems on ProjectEuler.net .
I have decided to create this repository because it seems like this will be a long running coding project for me, and because my posts on the Project Euler forums are not permanent.
Project Euler requests that solutions are not spoiled, but there are also people who will never want to participate. So, I will publish my solutions here for myself and those who want to see them; only from the first 100 problems.

I wanted something to work on while learning Common Lisp, and I think I have found it.
